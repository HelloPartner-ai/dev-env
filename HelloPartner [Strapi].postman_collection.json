James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties.

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\",\n\"chapters\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Introduction of Participants\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:00:38\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil introduces the team members participating in the meeting.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Overview of Hello Partner AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:01:11\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil provides an overview of Hello Partner AI and its focus on AI agents.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Understanding AI Agents\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:03:55\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demonstration of AI Capabilities\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:08:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:04:39\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with a bank CRM system.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Discussion on AI Intelligence\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:08:49\",\n                \"description\": \"James and Neil discuss how the AI agent gains intelligence and handles queries.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:12:35\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses potential future enhancements and functionalities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Language Capabilities of the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:13:08\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:12:43\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on the multilingual capabilities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demo Preparation for Upcoming Presentation\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:14:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:13:31\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses the need for a demo for an upcoming presentation to realtors.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Conversational AI and User Experience\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:16:07\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:15:12\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses the importance of conversational AI in user experience.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Exploring Data Integration\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:16:10\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on how to integrate various data sources for improved AI performance.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Training the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the training process for the AI and how it learns from interactions.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Use Cases for AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses potential future use cases for the AI in their business.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Next Steps and Coordination\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses next steps for the project and coordination among members.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Final Thoughts and Wrap-Up\",\n                \"end_time\": \"01:03:03\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"description\": \"The meeting concludes with final thoughts and next meeting arrangements.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\"\n}\n",

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\"}\n",

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\"}\n",

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint.

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\",\n\"chapters\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Introduction of Participants\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:00:38\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil introduces the team members participating in the meeting.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Overview of Hello Partner AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:01:11\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil provides an overview of Hello Partner AI and its focus on AI agents.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Understanding AI Agents\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:03:55\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demonstration of AI Capabilities\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:08:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:04:39\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with a bank CRM system.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Discussion on AI Intelligence\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:08:49\",\n                \"description\": \"James and Neil discuss how the AI agent gains intelligence and handles queries.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:12:35\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses potential future enhancements and functionalities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Language Capabilities of the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:13:08\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:12:43\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on the multilingual capabilities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demo Preparation for Upcoming Presentation\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:14:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:13:31\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses the need for a demo for an upcoming presentation to realtors.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Conversational AI and User Experience\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:16:07\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:15:12\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses the importance of conversational AI in user experience.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Exploring Data Integration\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:16:10\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on how to integrate various data sources for improved AI performance.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Training the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the training process for the AI and how it learns from interactions.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Use Cases for AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses potential future use cases for the AI in their business.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Next Steps and Coordination\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses next steps for the project and coordination among members.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Final Thoughts and Wrap-Up\",\n                \"end_time\": \"01:03:03\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"description\": \"The meeting concludes with final thoughts and next meeting arrangements.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\"\n}\n",

And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations.\\n(00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but\\nJames (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email\\nNeil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all.\"\n    }\n}"

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\",\n\"chapters\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Introduction of Participants\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:00:38\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil introduces the team members participating in the meeting.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Overview of Hello Partner AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:01:11\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil provides an overview of Hello Partner AI and its focus on AI agents.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Understanding AI Agents\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:03:55\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demonstration of AI Capabilities\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:08:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:04:39\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with a bank CRM system.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Discussion on AI Intelligence\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:08:49\",\n                \"description\": \"James and Neil discuss how the AI agent gains intelligence and handles queries.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:12:35\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses potential future enhancements and functionalities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Language Capabilities of the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:13:08\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:12:43\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on the multilingual capabilities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demo Preparation for Upcoming Presentation\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:14:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:13:31\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses the need for a demo for an upcoming presentation to realtors.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Conversational AI and User Experience\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:16:07\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:15:12\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses the importance of conversational AI in user experience.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Exploring Data Integration\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:16:10\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on how to integrate various data sources for improved AI performance.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Training the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the training process for the AI and how it learns from interactions.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Use Cases for AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses potential future use cases for the AI in their business.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Next Steps and Coordination\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses next steps for the project and coordination among members.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Final Thoughts and Wrap-Up\",\n                \"end_time\": \"01:03:03\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"description\": \"The meeting concludes with final thoughts and next meeting arrangements.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\"\n}\n",

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo.

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties.

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\",\n\"chapters\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Introduction of Participants\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:00:38\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil introduces the team members participating in the meeting.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Overview of Hello Partner AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:01:11\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil provides an overview of Hello Partner AI and its focus on AI agents.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Understanding AI Agents\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:03:55\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demonstration of AI Capabilities\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:08:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:04:39\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with a bank CRM system.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Discussion on AI Intelligence\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:08:49\",\n                \"description\": \"James and Neil discuss how the AI agent gains intelligence and handles queries.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:12:35\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses potential future enhancements and functionalities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Language Capabilities of the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:13:08\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:12:43\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on the multilingual capabilities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demo Preparation for Upcoming Presentation\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:14:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:13:31\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses the need for a demo for an upcoming presentation to realtors.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Conversational AI and User Experience\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:16:07\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:15:12\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses the importance of conversational AI in user experience.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Exploring Data Integration\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:16:10\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on how to integrate various data sources for improved AI performance.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Training the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the training process for the AI and how it learns from interactions.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Use Cases for AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses potential future use cases for the AI in their business.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Next Steps and Coordination\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses next steps for the project and coordination among members.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Final Thoughts and Wrap-Up\",\n                \"end_time\": \"01:03:03\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"description\": \"The meeting concludes with final thoughts and next meeting arrangements.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\"\n}\n",

Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\",\n\"chapters\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Introduction of Participants\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:00:38\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil introduces the team members participating in the meeting.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Overview of Hello Partner AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:01:11\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil provides an overview of Hello Partner AI and its focus on AI agents.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Understanding AI Agents\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:03:55\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demonstration of AI Capabilities\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:08:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:04:39\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with a bank CRM system.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Discussion on AI Intelligence\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:08:49\",\n                \"description\": \"James and Neil discuss how the AI agent gains intelligence and handles queries.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:12:35\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses potential future enhancements and functionalities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Language Capabilities of the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:13:08\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:12:43\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on the multilingual capabilities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demo Preparation for Upcoming Presentation\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:14:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:13:31\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses the need for a demo for an upcoming presentation to realtors.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Conversational AI and User Experience\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:16:07\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:15:12\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses the importance of conversational AI in user experience.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Exploring Data Integration\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:16:10\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on how to integrate various data sources for improved AI performance.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Training the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the training process for the AI and how it learns from interactions.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Use Cases for AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses potential future use cases for the AI in their business.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Next Steps and Coordination\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses next steps for the project and coordination among members.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Final Thoughts and Wrap-Up\",\n                \"end_time\": \"01:03:03\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"description\": \"The meeting concludes with final thoughts and next meeting arrangements.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\"\n}\n",

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties. It doesn't tell you what county tell you. I need to know in actually California, how many counties See it says Speaker 6 (01:03:03): Selected Neil (01:03:04): Counties. James (01:03:04): Yeah, exactly. So what counties Speaker 6 (01:03:08): Doesn't bring up the census tract either. That's also James (01:03:12): What counties allowed. Speaker 6 (01:03:14): So a lot of information from PowerPoints that also need to be said here for eligibility requirements, but maybe not all of 'em are on the\",\n\"chapters\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Introduction of Participants\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:00:38\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:00:00\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil introduces the team members participating in the meeting.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Overview of Hello Partner AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:01:11\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil provides an overview of Hello Partner AI and its focus on AI agents.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Understanding AI Agents\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:03:55\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:02:46\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the difference between AI agents and traditional chatbots.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demonstration of AI Capabilities\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:08:46\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:04:39\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil demonstrates how the AI agent interacts with a bank CRM system.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Discussion on AI Intelligence\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:08:49\",\n                \"description\": \"James and Neil discuss how the AI agent gains intelligence and handles queries.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:12:35\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:11:18\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses potential future enhancements and functionalities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Language Capabilities of the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:13:08\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:12:43\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on the multilingual capabilities of the AI agent.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Demo Preparation for Upcoming Presentation\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:14:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:13:31\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses the need for a demo for an upcoming presentation to realtors.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Conversational AI and User Experience\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:16:07\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:15:12\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses the importance of conversational AI in user experience.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Exploring Data Integration\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:16:10\",\n                \"description\": \"Discussion on how to integrate various data sources for improved AI performance.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Training the AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:20:30\",\n                \"description\": \"Neil explains the training process for the AI and how it learns from interactions.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Future Use Cases for AI\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:22:56\",\n                \"description\": \"James discusses potential future use cases for the AI in their business.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Next Steps and Coordination\",\n                \"end_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:25:00\",\n                \"description\": \"The team discusses next steps for the project and coordination among members.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"title\": \"Final Thoughts and Wrap-Up\",\n                \"end_time\": \"01:03:03\",\n                \"start_time\": \"00:27:40\",\n                \"description\": \"The meeting concludes with final thoughts and next meeting arrangements.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"title\": \"Future Development Ideas\"\n}\n",

James (00:00:06): Alright, Neil (00:00:06): So I'm going to just do quick introductions if that's okay? James (00:00:10): Sure, sure, sure. Neil (00:00:11): So this is Emil il. Emil (00:00:15): Hey there. Neil (00:00:16): This is over here. This is Mandy, she's the head of operations for GMCC and this is James Jin and he is the founder and chairman and CEO of the bank. And this is walking in is Tony. Aye. And he's a business strategist or business operations for GMC. James (00:00:37): He's my managing associate, yeah. Neil (00:00:38): Management associate. So James (00:00:41): He will help coordin the logistic if needed. Great. And he'll be layers liaison to kick off the project. Neil (00:00:47): Yeah. So thank you guys for joining. I don't have a PowerPoint presentation but I do have something to show at the end to all of you. My name is Neil Er and I am the CEO of hello partner ai. And with me today is Emil at OV and he's our head of development. He's based in Europe, so our development in Europe. Yes. James (00:01:11): I just see you next week, next Friday. I'm leaving Friday to Europe. What country? Bulgaria. Bulgaria. I'm a Neil (00:01:20): Swiss in London. It is pretty early there. They're 10 hours ahead of us so I think it's around 1:00 AM there. James (00:01:26): So, okay, thank you. I appreciate But by the way, our company working 24 hour, I normally send an email out 1:30 AM to make sure everybody working but good. Okay. Neil (00:01:36): Awesome. Awesome. Emil's used to that. James (00:01:41): No, I'll talk at 1:30 AM US time so your time should be fine. Neil (00:01:48): James and I had a chance to meet at the ACE National Conference a few weeks ago and he was very kind to ask me a little bit about my company and then invite me in and thought it might be useful to share with both of you. So hello partner.ai. We are very new. We just started this year just back in April, but our focus as a company is on focusing on the next generation what we think is going to revolutionize the enterprise in the workplace, which is AI agents. And so using artificial intelligence to empower enterprises and to empower their workers. So specifically we're very focused on building just AI agents. We don't do other types of AI and we differentiate ourselves from other companies that maybe build chat botts and things like that. But we focus on, you may be hearing a lot in the news, the word agents and so that's what we focus on as a company. (00:02:46): So an agent differentiates itself from a chat bot in the sense that when you chat with a chat bot on a website, it's very conversational. So it engages in conversational UI but beyond it doesn't really have any tools available to it. And by a tool, I mean if you want the agent to go out and search the internet for instance on your behalf, that's a tool. Or if you want the agent to be able to scan a PDF file and understand what the PDF file is about, it uses a different tool for that. If you want it to connect up to your CRM or database, those are different tools. James (00:03:23): Assistant agent means more like assistant Neil (00:03:25): Agent means assistant, it means help you not only can you have a conversation with it, but it can go out and figure out on its own if it means to kick James (00:03:34): Off different process. Neil (00:03:35): Yes. If it needs to use one of its tools to accomplish a task that you've given it. Interesting. James (00:03:40): It's like a processor. So we talk to processor, processor can to solidify the condition, they can do multitask and afterwards not just, I'll give you answer right away. So it can be night job. So we tell them what to do at a night, they can kick off some process Neil (00:03:55): Or we can create, for instance for enterprises, we can create special tools for each enterprise. So as an example in a demo that I'll show you today, we've created a special tool for this agent to go to a bank CRM system, a customer relation management system and be able to through conversation, be able to query that CRM system, pull data out of it and then present it back to the user in a way that they can understand so the user can ask questions of the agent using conversation. So let's say all of your bank products for instance, are inside of A CRM and it's very technical, then you can as an end user just explain to consumer, James (00:04:39): Okay, Neil (00:04:39): Explain to the agent your situation and then the agent through conversation can go to the CRM, pull up all your bank products, understand what each the about, and then present just those products that are adequate for what you are looking for as a consumer. James (00:04:57): How can this agent have this intelligence? Neil (00:05:00): That's part of what, when you combine a conversational UI with this ability to have backend systems and I'll show you that today. James (00:05:10): Yeah, I want to see how you can do it because this is a Chinese version. You have English version when you have an English version. So this other, the program, we have the full rest invest cashflow or the program. This actually, if the agent can read it and present it of card, probably the trained bio conversation, maybe we can recording 10 trend of the, they can learn from the data conversation. That'd be extremely powerful. That's something I would envision that, Neil (00:05:37): Why don't I just show you. Okay, that's James (00:05:40): Powerful. That's great Neil (00:05:41): Because I think it'll kind of pull it all together and then I, I'm happy to answer questions for you. Wonderful. And Emil's here as well. So the guy on the back end that does, so that's how we divide things up. I'm the guy on the front end. I train the ai, I'm guy that gets it to understand what the business use cases are and Emil's the guy on the backend that does all the backend web service programming. So if Emil and I work together and I say, oh we need a bank CRM and this is what the CM needs to look like, Emil's the one that put that in place and then put the layer together that actually the chatbot agent speaks to get to it. Okay, wonderful, wonderful. Let me share my screen really fast. Emil, I don't know if you'll be able to see it. Let me actually, you know what Emil, I'll share with you as well. How's that? James (00:06:31): Awesome. Neil (00:06:31): So you can see as well. Okay. And then I'm going to go over here and share. Interesting. There we go. Oh, I don't think I can share. I'm sorry Emil, you've seen just have to, I can't share with you I don't think and also share on the screen up here, but you know what's going on. So James (00:06:58): Screen is just a projection, it's not shared. I guess you have a shitty screen. Here we go. Screen is not sharing just a projection. Okay, whatever. There we go. I think it's going to Neil (00:07:07): Be okay. Now why is it still not Come on. Are we on the same network? Let me see. James (00:07:20): You don't have to go. We have English version, right? I want tomorrow should take, you don't need to go just later. Can you bring more copies for tomorrow? 10 30 in the office. Oh there it is. Okay. You don't need to do now. Neil (00:07:36): Oh, it's called Morgan. Morgan for mortgage. So I want to stress to you that this is just a prototype, okay? This is not the actual product at all is just a prototype. James (00:07:48): That's, that's interesting. I learned yours and li the customer. Neil (00:07:53): Yes, James (00:07:53): I like apply for loan. Tell me why. Neil (00:07:55): So I'd like you to pay attention to just a couple things as I use it, right? Pay attention please to the conversational nature of it, right? And then also please pay attention to how it goes out and uses its tools and goes out to the bank CR M to get information and then presents it back to me in a way that I can understand. So I'm going to pretend to be just one of your customers that goes onto your site. Alright? Now this could be embedded on your site, but right now it's just running on chat. GPP. Yeah, line chat. Just a chat. I can say publish. Hello Morgan and how can I assist you today? It wants to get my name and say, I'm going to just check. Can you see the bank? CRM? This is just me. I just want to make sure from here you can see. So now it's communicating actually to the bank, CRM and it says I have access to the bank, CRM including the following leads and products. James (00:08:46): What do you mean by bank crm? Neil (00:08:49): So we created just a sample CRM that would manage all of your customers basically and where they are, for instance in the sale pipeline. So if they just come on the first time, then they'll be at the beginning of the funnel. But if they come back a second or third time, Morgan will collect more and more information about the, James (00:09:07): So you track internally that information will be tell you basically the phone number Neil (00:09:12): With James (00:09:12): Their name names. Too many names. Our phone number will ika identify. Neil (00:09:16): So in this case, he's asking me, Morgan's asking me can I get your name? And so I'm just going to tell him my name and it's Neil Balzer. James (00:09:23): That's p, I'm a James. So too many James, right? Neil (00:09:27): So you James (00:09:27): Ask me again what's your last name or what's Neil (00:09:29): It it will try to disambiguate in this case there's only one Neil bald issue here. James (00:09:33): Oh, even more than one you ask again. Neil (00:09:36): So it says I found your record Neil, you're currently interested in a cash out refinance with the G-M-C-C-W-V-O-E program. So this is based on what I had gone in earlier today and it had asked me some questions and it James (00:09:49): Says you did it before. How do you get all this stuff cash out? 65% Neil (00:09:53): Right? This, James (00:09:54): How do you know this information? Cash out. Six, five, 4 million. Neil (00:09:57): We put some of your products in the bank. CRM. So we put some of them in there, right? So it would know them. So you remember the sheet that you gave me at James (00:10:06): The Yeah, I don't need a high 5,000 office. Maybe 50 office is good enough. Maybe just one more. Oh my god. No kidding. Neil (00:10:13): I know. So do you remember the sheet that you gave me? James (00:10:16): Yeah, yeah, yeah. The banks. I know, I know all the program so I was just surprised you. Neil (00:10:19): We put it in, we typed it in, we just put it directly in the CRM. Now James (00:10:24): Can you scan it right now? You enter Neil (00:10:25): Yourself, you can scan it so you can, yeah, you can just take a picture of it and James (00:10:29): Just can scan it Neil (00:10:30): And it will understand it. James (00:10:32): Yes. That's good. But I guess this question in your backend you do use the chat GBT or what language model using or I don't know, it doesn't matter. No high level using some kind of ai. Just Neil (00:10:46): So for the conversational ai, we're just using chat JPT and the LLM. And on the backend we've built our own CRM with our own very thin layer API that connects up to that CRM. So then within this particular prototype, this Morgan has what are called actions and the actions map to API endpoints that connect up to what we created A-G-M-C-C, basic CRMA, basic James (00:11:17): CRL. Neil (00:11:18): It has your products listed in it, it has customers listed in it and that's basically what it has. So when I come in, James (00:11:24): So in the beginning I can do with no officer later we come to consumer because comprise issue in the beginning. That's right. Just little law office ask a question so you can start issue an officer there another question, but future is really can go to consumer. Neil (00:11:37): Yes. Yeah. And that's a nice thing about this is it it can be extended, right? So our idea for you is we start off basic and we do a CS agent, that's a basic CS agent that's just answering customer's questions when they come onto your site making sense of you have a lot of different products for a lot of different situations. (00:11:56): So kind of guiding them through that. But along the way Morgan is putting information all the time into the CRM so that later when you want to develop that relationship or you want upsell them, we could create another agent that is a business development agent that can actually send an email sequence out to them saying, Hey, you visited our GMCC loan site last week, you were interested in this product, we wanted to let you know this is the type right? And maybe the next week after that it can say, hey, we're running a special but James (00:12:27): Child voltage just collect in the future you can let, let's say every six months, a couple months, ask a question, send email Neil (00:12:35): Or something. Yes. Yeah, you can do email sequences out and it would use yes, the CRM would control all James (00:12:41): Of that. So you can scan Chinese too I guess. Neil (00:12:43): Yes. Well I can say can Morgan you please switch to Mandarin? Mandarin? This James (00:12:53): Is powerful. The API guess Chinese one. Emil (00:12:57): Wow. James (00:13:02): Wow. And in fact Fortune did that too, but this is amazing. Tony (00:13:08): This is G-M-C-C-V-O-E, GM CO. James (00:13:31): Can you put quickly for my meeting there, something I'm going to tell you is next Thursday seven Chinese six, I'm going to speak 500 plus Chinese realtors 500 at the sitting Southern California. If I can do a quick demo, that'd be cool. Neil (00:13:50): I think we could probably James (00:13:51): Just a simple one doesn't have to be facing, Mandy (00:13:53): I really like the conversation piece of it because when the agent ask the question James (00:13:56): Yeah, they keep asking. Yeah I don't need, remember we don't do not need all the threats, right? You can just track by the internally you keep track database I guess. Neil (00:14:05): So here's an example. I am not familiar with all your products. I didn't know for instance what WVOE is. So I can say Morgan, what is WVOE? Now I didn't program this, but it says it stands for written verification of employment. James (00:14:24): So this is go out to reach or delete our data. How does it find a solution? Neil (00:14:28): This is using its James (00:14:29): GBT cell should have Neil (00:14:31): G BT itself. James (00:14:32): You should have basic information there, right? Neil (00:14:33): Yes. James (00:14:34): But then if we feed a more PowerPoint we'll probably give you more PowerPoint, pdf DF So they can read this information too. Neil (00:14:39): That's correct. And we can present it in any way that you want. But this is a great, because this actually educated me on your product. I was like, oh this is written verification of employment. So if I tell Morgan, Morgan, I am currently out of a job, thanks for sharing being out of job, sometimes make the approval loan process more complex, but there are still options available. For instance, some loan products like the might offer more flexibility and it gives me and I can say James (00:15:12): What other problem should be no ratio. We don't have one. No ratio there. Yeah. What other problem? Neil (00:15:18): So now it's checking your CRM. It's checking the gm, ccc, CRM and now remember I only put a few in there, so there's a lot more that you have but it's saying here's another one, gm, CCC 40 down non-qualified, James (00:15:29): No ratio. That's the one's kind of the no income, no DT. It's pretty good with your basic training. It's pretty good. This is pretty good already because we have not even fit the data we want. Neil (00:15:39): That's right. James (00:15:39): That's pretty Neil (00:15:40): Good actually. I just stuck data in there for it. I can say what the training a James (00:15:43): Little bit, but Neil (00:15:43): That's good enough. Which one is best for my situation? So now it's going to come back to given you're currently out of work, the 41, James (00:15:54): That's the winner. Oh my goodness, that's the winner. Mandy (00:15:57): Better than my brain. James (00:16:00): Well not bad but not bad. But unless you're drunk, Mandy, if you're drunk this better than other one. Know Neil (00:16:07): What's really cool is you can see the power of conversational ai. James (00:16:10): But you mentioned that last time can recording the phone conversation as well. Neil (00:16:13): We could. Yes. This one doesn't do it. James (00:16:16): You Neil (00:16:16): Have the ability to record it. You could do it through the phone, you could eventually do it through voice if you wanted because we have that ability. Mandy (00:16:25): I'm thinking if ful voice, can you do a different language like Mandarin? Neil (00:16:28): Yes. Yes. In fact you could be speaking to it in a Mandarin and it can reply to you in English James (00:16:34): How much or vice Neil (00:16:34): Versa you could speak to and it replies in James (00:16:36): Mandarin. My question is about how much training mean traditional model you have a now we can just dump data it's figured out that's a different ai, right? So before you had to train for the book train everybody. So now we just dump all the PowerPoint. It's just figured out. Neil (00:16:51): Yes, James (00:16:52): Ai they try to lead all the parameters. Yes Neil (00:16:54): We would help but that's part of my job. My job in training is once we've start putting your data into it, my job is to make sure it understands it and to train it and to correct it so that it completely understands it. It's not making mistakes. Mandy (00:17:08): So we need to train you to train the AI or I can train you to Neil (00:17:12): Train AI because the way you work kind of like an assistant, right? Think of it like an early college grad and so you kind of want to give it things to do and then you check its work, right? James (00:17:27): That so basically this is a Chinese, so lemme share English. So basically we can feed this one. Neil (00:17:34): Yes, that's what I did. All I did is I just fed this directly in to James (00:17:38): It. They don't even need a PowerPoint. It's just a picture file. Neil (00:17:41): Yes, James (00:17:42): That's OC. Whatever you have OC, whatever. You can read this thing, just feed it in. Ask this one. I ask can we do 10, 10% down? Does that work? I'm just curious. Can we do 10% down? Neil (00:17:54): I'm not sure what it'll do. I haven't programmed it to do this. James (00:17:58): It's okay. I'm just curious if you see, oh you can scan right now live. Neil (00:18:01): Yeah. Shit. James (00:18:02): No kidding. That's so cool man. So I don't have to train the backhand set up. People say Neil (00:18:20): So I'm just asked it. It's never seen it before. So I'm asking can you make sense of it James (00:18:27): 10% down. Okay. It's basically repeat itself reading into it but can ask question. Neil (00:18:36): Yes. James (00:18:36): So can we do 10% down? Neil (00:18:42): Do you want to change it? James (00:18:43): Just do. Can we do 10% now Neil (00:18:52): For up to 2 million? If you have a FIO score of seven 40 or higher James (00:18:58): Scale the PowerPoint. Neil (00:19:00): So I can say can you please James (00:19:02): Add you be the helo to save the landing will, but then you can elevate all the job for most officer you could lots and lots of the job now. Wow, that's really cool. You can scan the PowerPoint Speaker 6 (00:19:17): That OO two. Who was asking us at the last conference that we were at? Who was asking about that? W2 A CU or a James (00:19:23): DU? Speaker 6 (00:19:25): You could just type it in here and then James (00:19:28): Answer. Neil (00:19:28): So now I just added it now to your bank. CRMI just asked Morgan to please update the bank. CRM James (00:19:36): Neil can do the scenario support for us. The scenario whether C does, I Mandy (00:19:40): Do like the fact that you can do a conversations James (00:19:42): Conversation, not Mandy (00:19:43): Just reading from one email because the conversation James (00:19:46): Another question, I'm Mandy (00:19:47): More information. James (00:19:48): Another question is we have a senior desk study support so they can ask a lot on my LT V we have lot of answers. So basically do you can read all archive email, try to find the latest answer. So people that say know I'm 500,005 or six 80 and I want to find the best program, let's say income a hundred thousand enough we have the answer before save almost about 40, 50,000 data. Can you read all these emails and then just give the answer? Neil (00:20:17): Probably yes James (00:20:18): Possible, right? But right now we may or may not need to do that necessarily, but we just feed them. But our purpose the missing one among LT V fco, what's the best scenario? That's the missing. Mandy (00:20:30): That's why the conversation comes in. James (00:20:32): But how can they develop a solution? Mandy (00:20:34): They do a chat. James (00:20:36): They don't have the intelligence right now. Say LTVI use kno. They don't know yet. How do they know? Mandy (00:20:41): So instead of an email there us a chat, we track it as a check, James (00:20:49): They check how do you develop intelligence? We have this a fixed intelligence but they don't have scenario intelligence. So whatever here it has intelligence, right? The question that people asking by no other $1 million I do 50% down no job, right? So we have some answer already. The data or you can read all the guidelines to answer the question. I know we're talking about both solution. I think we need both. Neil (00:21:10): Yeah, we can do both. James (00:21:12): We can read all the emails before Neil (00:21:14): All James (00:21:14): The closure solution. Let's say some people the email hidden sound with the non QN can do A1C. What? The visa whatever silent. COA visa. So the question that information hidden somewhere, maybe you're able to find it, maybe not, but some for email will provide the past has an answer to the answers there. If reading this information, you can make it comfort. Okay, you know what, let me show this. Can you open another browser? Yes. Mandy (00:21:41): Thinking more product than do the production, the email, do a checkbox on a single sign, have a chat typing questions and then the AI will add ask for more questions. So in order to give James (00:21:58): Yes, but the question is we want a data. I don't want to get too much some information is there. So basically right now, today, let's see. So people coming here, I'm not very good at the so oh sure I do it for you. You could here see we'll ask all the information from an officer, no LTV, you can make a conversation, that's fine too. But this efficient provide all the information. So provide answer, right? This answer already here today will build an answer next time. If people ask the same question, they should be able to derive from here plus more intelligence. You don't have the exact answer. I think AI should be able to use this past answer plus own intent answer or like Mandi say or just interactive. We're open to it. Just open. But I think ask a minimum information, stay helpful. Other people ask Mar, I'm a 500 K, what's my rate? What do you mean? What's the rate? $4 All still need to ask that question. We got a conversation or we make a simple conversation with one time completion information. Neil (00:22:56): Yeah, you could balance it however you want. You could make it completely conversational. You can have it more structured. Are these in emails right now or James (00:23:04): It's go to email. Neil (00:23:05): This one goes to email this one. Go to email. You have Speaker 6 (00:23:07): A database full of Neil (00:23:08): The James (00:23:09): Oh you have a database. Speaker 6 (00:23:10): Not a strict database but I get James (00:23:13): We Neil (00:23:13): Archive Speaker 6 (00:23:13): List of emails, James (00:23:14): We about 50,000 emails. Neil (00:23:17): The emails are the form submissions. Speaker 6 (00:23:19): Yeah and then also most of 'em have answers too. Neil (00:23:22): Ah, that's really Speaker 6 (00:23:23): Helpful. James (00:23:24): Today we only have 40,000 email or 40,000 question, 40,000 answers in the email. So the two way I think your intelligent may or may not need that one, but I think ultimately you still have data to train. Neil (00:23:37): Sure, yeah that's great. Okay. Interesting. I wonder if I need to talk Emil, I don't know what the best way to do that is. We might want to train a separate, smaller, limited model LLM on that. I'm not sure. Depending how big it's James (00:23:55): But regardless, let's go back to the one. So this Morgan, right, this Morgan, we can even open to loan officer like many, they just keep asking question. Neil (00:24:08): Yes. James (00:24:08): But the question is for loan officer, there'll be multi scenario. Another one today will ask VOE tomorrow ask no jar another jump express. There'll be a little different for consumer product one, but consumer can sleep different property too. Rental bank statement or can be different. Well either way I guess you can always Mandy (00:24:29): Whatever we have. Putting the CMI guess, James (00:24:32): Right? Yes. Mandy (00:24:33): Whatever program we put in the CM. James (00:24:34): Yes. Whatever your program are, I think just amazing you it just scan it and just ask a question. Yeah. Neil (00:24:40): Yes. But that's the power, right? And then you can see how eventually we can build more agents out for you, right? So you could see how we could have one as a customer, a CS agent, right? And the CS agents really the front of the funnel, they first come to the GMCC loan website and it's there to greet them, kind like a person of the bank and kind of explain GMCC, kind of get them in, collect some James (00:25:07): Information. Think if we use this one for a couple months internally, then we can open to customer. We just don want, do not want to call the away but Neil (00:25:16): In. You could use it internally as well. James (00:25:18): Yeah, using internal first but late Mandy (00:25:20): The consumer. Right? Then when you come down to the R, when you ask the rig, James (00:25:23): Then we're cut. You get an office to call office come for the rate. We cannot call because Neil (00:25:30): I believe, let me see, is il, are you still on here? Emil? You Speaker 6 (00:25:32): Got disconnected when you search? Neil (00:25:34): Oh no, he hasn't been on here. Okay, sorry. You make a walk though. Yeah, I'll get back to him. Interesting. James (00:25:44): So how soon can we do something? Really? Can I just minimize this? I don't know if he's there. Oh you can just scan just Mandy (00:25:58): I know. Just scan and then they James (00:25:59): Already, that's very impressive demo. Thank you. We just scan a document, that's it. But how does it know which ones more if the country take each other, this one is 10%, 2,000,001 10, 10%, 3 million where you pick 20 million or they pick a 2 million or visit a timestamp. There's contradicting information. They don't happen. Neil (00:26:20): We'd have to test and see and train it. How to handle contradictory James (00:26:23): Information. I try wanted to ask us which one should pick. That's fine. Other means should be some color. Neil (00:26:27): Yes. And I wanted to say as well that if this were embedded onto your website, it can be set up so that at a certain point it can hand it over to a human. James (00:26:38): To Neil (00:26:38): Your point when the comes up it can say, you know what, now I'm going James (00:26:42): To, but this is more, you provide a lot more information, not just information taken. You provide more information to them than last step when you're human being to close the deal either way or whatever, that's not sensitive. This AI is a sensitive, you can have emotion also it can detect emotion of the, we Neil (00:27:01): Can change the tone of this so that it can be more friendly or more professional depending on what your brand image is. The other thing that we can do is we've built, for instance for another company, we built an account executive agent. And so this account executive in their use case, this account executive helps their human account executives close deals. So what they do, this agent that we built for them can actually review the call that the human account agent had with the customer and it can analyze the call and it analyzes it and it says this is the type of buyer that this customer is. They are very no nonsense. They want to just get straight to the facts. Wow. They want can James (00:27:51): Our office call, we can improve office Neil (00:27:54): IT profiles James (00:27:55): So we can long coming new. They're really dumb incompetent. So you can train them to be competent. Neil (00:28:01): Yes. And it says this is how you should handle and it actually says these are the potential objections that they're going to have. How to get this intelligence Mandy (00:28:10): Though. Yeah. Depends on what information you fit to the CRM. Neil (00:28:15): That's part of what we do. James (00:28:17): You have the lu, I know that, but you're just using the good one to record it or you have good intelligent people compared to other conversation. You must have reference point, right? Neil (00:28:28): Yeah. Well generally I'm, I'm the trainer, right? So I'm the one that's training it. James (00:28:35): We have to become our top producer. Need to be one. Neil (00:28:38): Yes. For the James (00:28:39): Lending. You could do the basic training of course with all respect, but sales mortgage different. So we will get many top producer to come in the share expertise at the beginning I can train the whole team so slowly they become, each field has own right, but beginning of course basic common sense. You can change this one but later become much more technical. Then I think some we have a trainer trained together. Neil (00:29:04): Yeah, if you get large to that, yes you would have your own people inside how to train this one that would be specifically set up to manage your agents basically. James (00:29:13): Oh, manage. Just multi agent. Okay. Neil (00:29:15): Yeah, you might have multiple ones, right? So the nice thing I just want to point out, here's the actual database right here. This is the database that we set up for you. And so this is me and you can see it's telling James (00:29:29): The Neil (00:29:30): That's the product I'm interested in and it's kept, James (00:29:34): It's actually, can I ask a question? How do you use a celebrity grant? Do you have that set up? Neil (00:29:38): What's James (00:29:38): That? Celebrity is a grant. Can I ask that question? I'm just curious. Neil (00:29:42): There's a right now, right there. That one? James (00:29:44): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can ask in the composition. Can I ask question? So how to qualify celebrity grant requirement? What's requirement? Emil (00:30:08): Sorry. Wow, Neil (00:30:38): Is that correct? Can you scroll Speaker 6 (00:30:41): Down a little bit more like there's the button doesn't have CT require. We James (00:30:56): Have some inhouse one but I think yours might be more accurate. Okay. Oh this means you copied the stuff from over there. Neil (00:31:25): I did, yes. James (00:31:29): Okay. And it can be, Chinese can be conversation, I think conversation the program itself we can do today. But your conversational said what's the best program for no ratio. I think that that's more intelligent yourself. Yes. I just wondering if you can read the email to get an answer that we can the law office to use it. I want see how the answer but you're not there yet. For example, I want ask you can lemme to ask question please. Lemme ask question. Mandy (00:31:56): So they can type in Chinese and you still can recognize, right? Neil (00:31:59): Yes, yes. There's I think 48 languages. Yes. From governor James (00:32:04): GBT. Which program for BOLO loan among 600 K-F-O-F-O six 80 and house value 800 K. Income 400 K primary. See Emil (00:32:33): Let me change that to fico. Oh, okay. Chat. GBT looks like it's, James (00:32:46): Have you worked with any other market company yet? Neil (00:32:50): No. You guys are the, which is why I'm interested. You guys are the first. I've worked with other two other companies. Yeah. What James (00:32:59): Business are they Neil (00:32:59): In? One is a MarTech company, so marketing technology company and the other is a skincare brand. Skincare. James (00:33:08): Yes. We profit, how do you say most the independent mortgage bank or merchant and it was a complete collection of all the possible Neil (00:33:22): Problem. Hold on. Sometimes see it. It's not checking. I have to tell it to check this year. James (00:33:29): Why didn't you ask it? Are this support check or Neil (00:33:38): I don't think you have a jumbo express loan James (00:33:42): Actually is pretty good. We can do 400 k Ash is pretty good. Neil (00:33:45): So of the ones I only have four in James (00:33:47): There. I know, I know you are very limited. I just want see it. Neil (00:33:50): So this is the one of four. This is, James (00:33:52): You know what you have to get? You need to read the email. You have to read the email because other PowerPoint will not give you pricing for this one. The email will. So maybe we have to have read the email. It cannot just conversation because that's into conversation. Doesn't matter how many point you put there. The out point would teach them low amount, 600 K, LT V, they're not going to teach you them. That part. This part comes from email people asking questions 600 K. Then Mandy thing will tell you, oh you go to Epps pricing, you go to this. You do internal. We have the training at Neil (00:34:25): Some point. Could I see some of those emails? James (00:34:27): Yeah, I think Mandy we can send to maybe Tony. Tony maybe can send some email to you. Yeah, we Neil (00:34:33): Can. That'd be great. I think that would help. James (00:34:34): Yeah, just email support. We can give some example emails. I think you have to do the email for the C support. Neil (00:34:40): Okay. Or if you want to just export a CVS file, then I can just reimport that into the sample. James (00:34:49): We Neil (00:34:49): Can do CRM here. James (00:34:52): Okay. Alright. Okay. Neil (00:34:53): Yeah. So that's what I wanted to show you what we're capable of and what I think the future could be. James (00:35:03): Yeah, I think read the email to support that in the future. I like the one you asking, what's the best program? That's interesting. What's the best program if no job conversation or no job. I think that's how people talk, right? Yeah. You track the person's older history, you Neil (00:35:18): Order track James (00:35:20): Phone number, that's your CR database and you track. Neil (00:35:22): That's what we do now as it gathers more information, it updates the customer CRM database as it gets more. James (00:35:29): That's your database you to But this hosting by Amazon or who host this? Neil (00:35:34): This is through Airtable. So we're using a third party company called Airtable. If you have your own database, we just use it. James (00:35:41): We don't have a database like that. AI table. Is it like Amazon or who's cloud servicing? Neil (00:35:47): Airtable. Airtable. Airtable is the company. James (00:35:50): Yeah. So cloud service table. Amazon, Google or this field. Neil (00:35:54): There's a bunch of 'em. James (00:35:55): Oh there's different Different One Air. Neil (00:35:56): Yeah, we just used Airtable because they're fast to set up. They're relatively inexpensive and they give this nice interface through the web. James (00:36:04): Oh that's Neil (00:36:04): Why James (00:36:05): It was fast. So question for example, you talk this follow John. So next one Smith's coming seen scenario. Scenario. You should be able to derive information from John, right? To help Smith. Speaker 6 (00:36:19): Smith scenario. James (00:36:21): If John has 600 K, so the next one Smith coming has 700 K, but everything similar AI should be able to use the scenario for John to help Smith. Is it or no? Neil (00:36:33): You mean two different James (00:36:34): People come in? Yeah, but the situation, similar Neil (00:36:36): Data, it should be able to determine that it's similar enough. James (00:36:40): Yeah, that's my question. If you able to determine that'd be more useful. Otherwise the numbers, Neil (00:36:45): It doesn't have to be exact. James (00:36:46): Yeah, Neil (00:36:46): It's going to try to find the best fit program. James (00:36:49): That's why I say based on the database, they should be find out one for this particular person, another one, all the data similar you should be derived to answer someone else. That's ai. Otherwise there's no ai. Everybody can do it. That's right. Neil (00:37:02): And it should be able to do that. That's what it's technically doing right now. I only have six programs in there though. James (00:37:07): Yeah, they try to play with, Neil (00:37:08): It's trying to look at all six and based on what it knows about you it's trying to say this is now we can also specifically train it and say we'll put more emphasis on this particular aspect or emphasize this less James (00:37:20): Another question, this data or this program more proprietary to GNC. So we need to keep up within GC. Emil (00:37:27): Yes. James (00:37:28): Just program knowledge. That's really important one, yes, we don't want to teach our competition but I guess ideally you can develop someone something for other company. But for this particular our program PowerPoint. That's why we you sign NDA. Yes. It would just be your products. This is my program, my training with particular, we have to be under gcc. That's actually very important. I think if you go to bank, they probably say you cannot use any asset party. Every server had to be stolen in the bank. Neil (00:37:58): Yes. And I mean we could certainly do that as well. These are all eventual implementation James (00:38:04): Details. Neil (00:38:06): I James (00:38:06): Just want to tell you this. Okay, so what's the next step? What do you suggest? Neil (00:38:12): So it sounds like you'd like to show something to some people. If that's still the case, then that would be something we need to jump on. I think we probably, James (00:38:26): The one issue is very interesting you put in Chinese because next week I can do the Chinese ones. Really interesting. Change the Chinese. Yeah, I think I did it here. Mandy (00:38:34): I think just on the top of my head suggestions before your conversation maybe ask, do you prefer English or Mandarin? James (00:38:42): Yes. Mandy (00:38:42): So you they click Mandarin. Then James (00:38:44): The, so something we can do, if we can do quick demo, if we can do it, basically this is Chinese version, right? We have English version too, right? You scan, we can give a soft copy. You don't have to read this page, but we have PD file, we email you. So if a Chinese version read it in. So I'm just going to ask a question in Chinese at demo. That'd be so cool because I gave this Power point to other realtors people. Okay. Right. Nobody know much. So then I say tap in. What does buy without sale? I just tell them, oh did you scan a buy without sale? Neil (00:39:21): Maybe not. What's the name James (00:39:22): Of the program? Buy without sale. They'll say anywhere. Buy without sell can just type in, maybe not scan. It's okay if it doesn't cancel. If I buy without sale first, Tony (00:39:41): Scrolling down first Neil (00:39:48): It's checking. I'm not sure James (00:39:51): If there is not. If not, I think we can send you A-P-D-F-I. I can scan pdf d. That's good enough. We just want show this one for this. Actually we can just one pass. Yeah, there's no specific. Okay. It's not Scan not, that's no problem. So if you We Neil (00:40:05): Could put James (00:40:05): It in. Yeah, we can put it in. You can speak in Chinese English version Neil (00:40:09): And to your earlier point, if they immediately come in and start speaking Mandarin, it will automatically switch to Mandarin. So we don't even have to ask them, it's just whatever language they start speaking. James (00:40:23): Oh, but if I'm using my laptop and you changing my typing language, unless your cell phone take in the detail. I don't dunno how to type keyboard. Yours Speaker 6 (00:40:31): Easy. Do you have a laptop? James? I can set it up for you. James (00:40:34): You switch keyboard, right? You can switch the keyboard. You go the keyboard tapping. Interesting. Neil (00:40:41): So I would say maybe a next step would be for us to do a little more technical gathering of information and then I can put maybe some type of quote together for you. James (00:40:57): You could tell us how much it costs also. Neil (00:40:59): Yes. James (00:40:59): Yeah. Just as I don't cost a lag or which should be fine. Neil (00:41:07): Well, and there's two different paths that we can take. So one path is where, and it's the most expensive path, but it means you own everything. (00:41:15): And that's where you basically just hire us as the company to build your custom solution. And at the end of that, we turn all the source code and everything over to you and you deploy it on your servers and you manage it and it's yours. You own everything, right? But that's expensive. That's the most expensive option. That would be over a hundred thousand dollars just because we have to pay a team to write it. The other option is that we as hello partner, work with you on our dime. We pay for it basically. And then when we turn it over to you, you pay us a monthly to use it. And that's a lot less to do that James (00:42:01): Per usage. Yeah, per usage. Neil (00:42:03): Yeah. So those are the two, I think they're two extremes, but I think it illustrates ones that you own everything, right? It's yours, you do whatever you want to it. And the other is you don't even think about it. It's just like, James (00:42:18): So you guys can continue to develop based on these then you just charge it by the usage, right? Neil (00:42:23): Yes. James (00:42:25): I think that's good. We would do that at one pocket side. So then we can a developer get something useful. And I think we can give you guys feedback also that it's lot of the domain knowledge to developers. Neil (00:42:37): Yeah, that's a nice way to go because it's also less expensive. And then you can pretty quickly see if it's working and you can collect those metrics, right? And then you can say we can constantly Mandy (00:42:47): Update the content, right? Neil (00:42:49): Yes, James (00:42:50): Yes. Lemme use this one to change it to English. Let's say change it to Mandarin. Mandarin. Think about next week. Interesting. So how to type you change Mandarin, say Neil (00:43:03): Bio without No still you can speak in English and it'll respond in Mandarin. James (00:43:07): Oh really? Neil (00:43:08): Yes. James (00:43:09): Oh that's Neil (00:43:10): Beautiful. Okay, so it's just going to be responding in Mandarin. Now one, James (00:43:15): What is Jambo Express? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, okay, okay. Now realize, okay, can read English, it doesn't care. Whatever you input is just responding. Oh, let's tell it. Sorry, tell again. So always respond. Oh, I see. See it's just one time you say now unless you change it back. I, Emil (00:43:44): Okay, James (00:43:49): Jesus. I think that's make simple goal. If we can do something. So Tony, I think have nailed email in the invite. So email the two PDF file one English one Chinese. If you can just scan in it and we can just use this one to a demo to the realtor as a first step. If you can do that. I don't know how much take time and they give us a proposal, but we want to do more. Definitely more than Emil (00:44:14): That. Okay. James (00:44:16): Yeah, great. You can do a demo. Maybe you can give me login to demo for the, Neil (00:44:21): Yes, I'll give you access. James (00:44:24): Okay. What day is it? September 26th. So I want to test out, make sure it works on next Thursday. Neil (00:44:30): So James has a, he's presenting to some bankers next 500 realtors. 500 realtors. Realtors on the 26th. 26th. So we want to try to get him access and Tony's going to get me some new programs to put in suppliers James (00:44:47): Just to PDF their file. Basically just this, copy it simple. I'm not going to present this one. Neil (00:44:51): We'll try to get that a few days done. A few days ahead of your presentation. Yeah, Monday, James (00:44:55): That'd be great. If not, we'll do Neil (00:44:56): Something else. Mandy (00:44:57): Can we change from Morgan to James? Is ask James? James (00:45:01): Yeah, Mandy (00:45:02): Ask Morgan people we just don't know. James (00:45:03): Yeah, we can change it to James. James the master. Neil (00:45:05): Yeah, James the master. Yes. We can change the name James (00:45:08): Actually to call me the God the lending. God Neil (00:45:10): The lending. God yes. I can change it. No problem. Change it to James. James (00:45:17): Oh that'd be great. Neil (00:45:18): Great. James (00:45:18): That's awesome. Neil (00:45:19): And then who should I coordinate with about a second meeting? James (00:45:23): Tony. Neil (00:45:25): Okay, James (00:45:26): Great. I'm leaving Wednesday. Maybe if anything works on Monday or test out, we can maybe reconvene again Tuesday. Neil (00:45:33): Yeah, I'm happy to come back once we have this so you James (00:45:36): Make sure it works for you Neil (00:45:38): Before you go onto to your James (00:45:39): Yeah, Monday we send a link or just play with a little bit with instruction. Like a change I, I'll respond Mandarin. Couple lines you just showed me I didn't have Follow your couple lines. I'm going to ask Neil (00:45:50): Different question. So you'd like it to always respond in Mandarin? James (00:45:53): No, not always. No, no. I just like your instructions said please always respond or please respond English. I don't know all this because I can instructed, I want to make it flexible. The flexible is perfect, not so just kind of tell you I just want to know the conversation. Okay. Now use English to respond. It's just human language. That's it. And it'll do it. Oh no, I now use English to respond. Neil (00:46:27): It should still be in English. I would. James (00:46:29): Okay, what is particular? Lemme ask. Lemme see. Why is it? I think you probably say P always or that's why I say in the demo, I need to know the switch. English maybe maybe the command. Some kind of key. Neil (00:46:57): I'll make sure this is working for you. Okay, James (00:47:00): Yeah, things like that with a demo. There we go. There you go. So use doesn't help. You have to use challenge. I say switch. Neil (00:47:08): Yeah, switch English. Switch to Mandarin. Stay in Mandarin. James (00:47:14): That's really cool. Great. Yeah, I think that's good. I think we want, I think Tony you sent this one. Maybe give some emails, give us hundred or emails or thousand emails. I dunno can ask a talk. Speaker 6 (00:47:28): How many many emails would you want to train the AI on? Neil (00:47:35): Why don't we start with a smaller set and I'll see how it does with it and if we need more then we can give it more. A hundred thousand or a hundred. James (00:47:44): Yeah. How Neil (00:47:45): Many thousand, how many, are these just going to be kind of random or are they going to be focused on a certain type James (00:47:51): Of No, they're just random. Any question? Neil (00:47:52): Yeah, I think we Speaker 6 (00:47:52): Might just take, I'll just random hundred screenshots I guess of our emails and the reply and then James (00:47:59): We archive by month or something. A thousand emails. Can they come in in a CSV or anything like that? We have archive. Speaker 6 (00:48:06): Well I'll have to check but I going to download it straight from the email. I see. So if we can do it. James (00:48:12): Todd had downloaded already, right? There were 40,000 emails still being downloaded. I don't know how long they take. They have CSV file I think. Yeah, I Neil (00:48:18): Can talk to our IT James (00:48:19): Person. Neil (00:48:21): It's easier if it's in a CSV because they can just load it up into the CRM. If it's in emails then it's more manual. The process is James (00:48:29): Slower. No, I think the file should be already downloaded. I don't know what's the format but it's already downloaded. So maybe get a thousand emails, something it make more sense. Emil (00:48:38): Great. James (00:48:39): Yeah, with the email and with the email and with together. I think that'd be helpful. Okay. Emil (00:48:47): Okay. James (00:48:47): Yeah. Another one is I really wanted to, can you record in my voice? We do live call, we train some consumer love recording the intention building in so that law office can learn. So right now do in person train the office. So technically I can use a Morgan to train the office, take my brain stuck into their train of office to answer the question. Neil (00:49:11): But how is that done? Is that done through telephone you said or video conference James (00:49:15): Consumer make a phone call, right? Typically. Oh my website inquire consumer will call you. Oh James, I got your information. Oh I want know show great. We into the company on LT VI teach them why we can offer this good program. What's the interest rate? The process. I want to replicate most of the office not very good. So right now I need teach them every Tuesday, Friday teach it how to speak, how to talk, how to. Neil (00:49:41): I see. So it sounds like there might be several different products here. One is a consumer facing product and then one is for back office for training loan officers. James (00:49:51): Is that correct? Yeah, because right now we're basically company ultimately B2C, right? How do you say it? Not consumer, right? We get a law officer to talk to consumer if the process is not efficient, 20% are very good. 40% soso. The 40% other 40% useless basically. So what improve the useless part become useful and the media occupant can talk. So our commercialization, so instead of 20 people good now become 40 people become very good. I see. Instead I have a person to coach every single person I can use a Morgan to coach them. Neil (00:50:24): I see. So that really is like a James James (00:50:27): Agent basically it's a coaching agent. I coach people so much they cook two loans, make 10,000 a month. They did a 36 unit month, they make 180,000 a month. Neil (00:50:36): Is that your number one use case? Is that the thing that would make the biggest impact on your business? James (00:50:42): Yeah, it's going to be very helpful for, so it is a sales, it's not a coding and mechanical the tone, you do it, you listen to other people. There are lots of sales training there. So how you position yourself building, I think if you could inject to the loan officer Neil (00:50:58): Some James (00:50:58): People. Neil (00:50:59): And how is that done today? How is the training done today James (00:51:03): With online meeting? Friday is technical I think technically helpful. But we have city branch now technically fly over each branch to teach you. Neil (00:51:13): I see. And would you envision this as being more as a one-on-one process with an agent, like an AI agent where they might sit down at their desk and then go one-on-one do it type of James (00:51:24): Thing. So we go there. So typically with a group of training we talk about sales, marketing. Oh they find guidance and then for the top one, I coach them one-to-one session, teach them, open them. It's helping them build a good relationship. The family. So most people, they don't know how to communicate. So I teach them not knowledge, teaching them social skill, emotional connection, skill. But I think something can be done through the ai. Neil (00:51:47): Okay. So it sounds like that is kind of what you would like a spec on is that at one point, at one point, what's the first thing that you would like me to work on? Mandy (00:51:58): This one is the first thing. Neil (00:52:00): This one. Mandy (00:52:00): This one. So with him giving you more emails and giving you in English. So you can go in James (00:52:07): English, Chinese, give them both. Mandy (00:52:08): So we can go in with the CRM with more. James (00:52:11): Oh English Chinese, doesn't matter. They will translate Chinese self anyway. It will. But the Chinese translation is not accurate. Definitely easier. Google translate for sure. There's no knowledge Neil (00:52:21): We could try it. We could take a, James (00:52:22): I think, can Neil (00:52:23): I take one of these? James (00:52:24): Yeah, sure, sure. You have English copy already though. Neil (00:52:27): And I'll just scan the Mandarin. Maybe James (00:52:31): We can give you, we can P file brochure and a Chinese, we post brochure. I'll give you post brochures, the translation, Google translate whatever is not accurate. It's not accurate. It's not accurate. That's why we have difficult time human being to translate. But if you could coach it a little bit later, it might be become more accurate. But this is great working with his Spanish too. Neil (00:52:50): So for lack of a better name, Morgan. This one? Yeah, Morgan. Would you see Morgan being used on your website? How would you see it being deployed? James (00:52:59): I think just GCC. We just ask g CCC is fine Mandy (00:53:03): For now. I think first step will be internal use with the agents to ask questions. And then another step will be to open to consumer to go in on our website to ask questions. And what James talked about is the third is sales milestone to improve the agent sales and marketing skills by learning from James. But instead of the learning from him on the one-to-one meeting because that's only one James. We have 600 agents. If we can have ask James here, James, the mastermind here, then they can, if the mastermind and the agent one-on-one. So he doesn't have to be feasible there. Neil (00:53:42): Which hundred? Which hundred. So three different use cases Mandy (00:53:45): Then? Yes. Neil (00:53:46): Okay, that's good. And they make logical. Mandy (00:53:48): That's all we have think of right now in the last half an hour. In the future we can think of more usage. Usage, this powerful James (00:53:54): Something. The chain we're doing is we have a hours version that may not apply to you yet. So right now people can tap in, let's say interest rate over 6%. We identify certain area of cala 150 listing. 60 listing can qualify 5.25. Neil (00:54:14): I see. James (00:54:15): Okay. That's crazy. So AO doesn't have to pick a phone call because you should tell the 60 listing this agent whatever they can do that. You can take a market city by city instead of one by one. You do dozen by dozen. (00:54:30): This going to break through. But it takes too long for me to train every individually. My top is change this AI use for lock people. I say you must kidding, you'll be gone by the time other people using it. Having said that, I still want the agency people. I want to use it. So I take it down right enough. So what I did is in person, I grabbed the person sitting that right now to me left. I teach them both the top ones. I cannot do that for 600 people. So I want to use the sales master rather people take my language. Everything just sit down virtually. I like the name sales master. Neil (00:55:04): That's what it's doing, right? James (00:55:06): This the ai, the one we're doing, the people doesn't have it. Most people can even capture, they don't even stand what's going on before they go wash away. They don't even know why they get a workshop. But we want inject this all pretty quickly into my people. Neil (00:55:20): And so if you could also put some thought into what would be your measures of success in terms of metrics, that would be helpful too. So for each of the three things we talked about, what would be, how would we measure success? We don't have to come up with that here, but I think as we move forward that would be really helpful. Speaker 6 (00:55:38): Do you have any ideas on what KPIs? Because I think there are too many different factors that go into our main KPIs would be the amount of loans that they close and the volume and the amount. I James (00:55:50): Think it combined with SEO affiliate, managing the hour place consumer might be very useful. So right now I don't like a co center model. I like an intelligence model. People can give them more information. So my suggestion is they take a long application, they fill out, then we assign office. So people typically talk to people for hour. Hour, they take this's too much work. They will tell them what the inte can do roughly. Then they fill application, they send in-house, in office. I think this can revamp the model Emil (00:56:21): Because James (00:56:21): Of the value offering. Because with so much program now you show the good stuff. I think that's probably, Mandy (00:56:26): So for the consumer part application is the measurable. James (00:56:29): Yeah, that's what me, I Mandy (00:56:30): See Matrix, right? How many application we got from the consumer. I think from the internal AI side, internal production side, how much inquiry you got, if it's useful, you're going to get a lot more. But if the agent one is not useful, then you just James (00:56:47): So support right now have four or five people. Now maybe we only need one or two people to support them. And I think the long run growth is measures we 600 people. Now ultimately we want will go to 3, 5, 2 to 3000 more office, 5,000 more. So we need to have Chinese people. No, this one we only Mandy (00:57:05): Need two to three people. Interesting. So if it is successful, you will see a lot more traffic, James (00:57:10): It evolving product, it's not going to happen immediately. But if it's Neil (00:57:12): Successful, so one metric would be how quickly you can train quality people up, right? Another metric is of the people you have, you said something like 40% don't really perform. If you can even get some fraction of them performing, that helps your James (00:57:27): Top line. I think support desk could, if very intelligent, they'll help support the law officer first. Then we can support consume. There's two part can be in parallel. Another one we're thinking about credit AI just for realtor to use lots of people asking that. Interesting. So right now we provide one version for law officer. We probably create one version for realtor, Emil (00:57:48): Professional James (00:57:49): Partners or builders and then we could another version probably consumer. These all can be continue for, they're Neil (00:57:56): Kind of all variations of the same. Right? James (00:57:57): Variation. Neil (00:58:00): So realtors and builders would use it as an interface to your products to James (00:58:04): Be able to them hedge educate so Neil (00:58:07): They know they can speak directly to James (00:58:10): Ultimately need use Neil (00:58:11): The applicants or they they're going to take interesting James (00:58:13): To the realtor builders model B2B right to the consumer B2C. So our internal people is B2B as well. So there's different variance. Neil (00:58:21): Interesting. Okay. That's helpful. James (00:58:24): Thank you. It's very interesting. So maybe my older thought is if I could do CPA financial planner, insurance insurancey set, whatever the professional feel, they have own application maybe using ai. They don't need their own application. We just give a couple questions to tell them what to do. Ultimately can create one application. Can you do graph video? Not yet. Neil (00:58:48): I believe. I have to check. We might be able to do graphs. James (00:58:51): If you can do some graph or image, a video would be very helpful. For Neil (00:58:55): What kind of video? James (00:58:56): It's just a simple What do you mean by without sales? Oh, you're using language right now You can speak right without that means, right, but maybe do a simple video. People can watch 30 seconds. So based on this one you can create a simple video. Neil (00:59:10): Interesting. I will try that. There might be something we can do. It might be more like a PowerPoint presentation. James (00:59:18): Just a simple video pop out that's good enough Neil (00:59:20): With narration. James (00:59:22): Yeah. For next week I just can talk about two program. No job, no faculty, no ratio. Another one about, that's it. I have 10, 15 minutes. So people, if you can use ai, they click to shoot. This would be crazy. People can like, wow, I don't have, IM busy. They don't, I don't want everybody call me. Our AI can do. Emil (00:59:41): Okay, James (00:59:44): Interesting. If anything we can do, maybe we can track it down. So if you can do click not speak or video, simple video, that'd be awesome. Neil (00:59:51): Not for next week. I want to make sure I said that. We can only speak. It can speak, it can speak James (00:59:59): Video. A lot of people say video too. Still like imagery, right? Not enough data to create. Generate. Okay. We'll leave with the great. Well we can do, I think if we generate this one in Neil (01:00:13): Time James (01:00:13): We could Neil (01:00:14): Yeah. James (01:00:14): For not ask GN CCC or Ask Jam should be fine. I coach lot law officer, they close long one unit to be a hundred million a year. Soultimately. We ultimate goal, I build elite group. I take a brand new people who close some loans slow in three months in ai they become Master Jada. Apprentice Jada. Neil (01:00:40): I can see how that would definitely help you grow your business. James (01:00:42): Yeah, so most people are just do riding bicycle. Everybody riding bicycle. We have electric car. Electric car here. They have a lock here. So people, but it's difficult, right? Not everybody can go to lock it. Some people not capable, they cannot see it. Some people just too minutes sleep or too much. Then you walk out to be fit. That's great. I think that's two step by step. That's little. B2B, a couple version. That's a demo first. September 26th. If by Monday you can start work version can demo. You can scan both flyer, then you can get sync. I like you scan fly too. Go PowerPoint too. You can scan the guidelines. There's more detail can scan. Maybe we should give a couple more PowerPoint. I think maybe we can give some PowerPoint. Buy without sale. Can you? Mandy (01:01:34): I think for the next week the brochure will be good. James (01:01:37): Okay. Put the buy. Okay. Give buy without sale, but buy without too much technical. Yeah, it's okay. Feed the buy with buy without sale. Buy without sale. PowerPoint, universe. PowerPoint Universe. PowerPoint. No ratio. Grand. 10,003 PowerPoint. Neil (01:01:57): So will Tony be kind of my interface for this? James (01:02:00): Yeah. Okay. I won't be involved in media, but Tony will, I'll be traveling. So Tony will be the one. Yeah. So basically 10,000 grand program for California. No job or no ratio falling. Okay. And then number three is the battle sale. These are actually three things I'll talk about next Thursday. Originally I can present regularly so this time can make a little fun using the demo. Neil (01:02:24): Do you want to keep the existing programs I have in there or take them out? James (01:02:28): I don't care. It doesn't matter. That's fine. Kick it out. Neil (01:02:32): Because celebrities in there and Yeah, James (01:02:33): That's okay. Whatever you have doesn't matter. That's okay. Just we have new PowerPoint. There's more detail there. Okay, Neil (01:02:38): So three new products. It sounds James (01:02:40): Like Mandy (01:02:41): It's not really new, but you have a fire. We give you a James (01:02:45): PowerPoint. PowerPoint to supporting. There are a lot more detailed guidelines. Oh, I see. See there are a lot more detailed example. Man, I did a good job, created all the PowerPoint. For Speaker 6 (01:02:52): Example, with the grant, there are some things in this grant that is in the PowerPoint. James (01:02:56): See it doesn't tell you which counties.
